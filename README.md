Abstract

Context: 

This thesis deals with the robustness testing of web applications on
a different web browser using a Selenium WebDriver to automate the browser.
To increase the efficiency of this automation testing, we are using a robustness
method. Robustness method is a process of testing the behaviour of a system implementation under exceptional execution conditions to check if it still fulfils some
robustness requirements. These robustness tests often apply random algorithms
to select the actions to be executed on web applications. The search-based technique was used to automatically generate effective test cases, consisting of initial
conditions and fault sequences. The success criteria in most cases: "if it does not
crash or hang application, then it is robust".
Problem: Software testing consumes a lot of time, labour-intensive to write test
cases and expensive in a software development life cycle. There was always a need
for software testing to decrease the testing time. Manual testing requires a lot of
effort and hard work if we measure in terms of person per month [1]. To overcome
this problem, we are using a search-based approach for robustness testing of web
applications which can dramatically reduce the human effort, time and the costs
related to testing.


Objective: 

The purpose of this thesis is to develop an automated approach to
carry out robustness testing of web applications focusing on revealing defects related to a sequence of events triggered by a web system. To do so, we will employ
search-based techniques (e.g., NSGA-II algorithm [1]). The main focus is on Ericsson Digital BSS systems, with a special focus on robustness testing. The main
purpose of this master thesis is to aim at the robustness testing to optimize the
test sequence length by minimizing their length, while simultaneously maximizing
the fault revelation.


Method: 

For this approach, a meta-heuristic search-based genetic algorithm is
used to make efficiency for robustness testing of the web application. In order to
evaluate the effectiveness of this proposed approach, the experimental procedure
is adapted. For this, an experimental testbed is set up. The effectiveness of the
proposed approach is measured by two objectives: Fault revelation, Test sequence
length. The effectiveness is also measured by evaluating the feasible cost-effective
output test cases.
Results:The results we collected from our approach shows that by reducing the
test sequence length we can reduce the time consuming and by using the NSGA-2
algorithm we found as many faults as we can when we tested on web applications
in Ericsson.


Conclusion: 

The attempt of testing of web applications, was partly succeeded.
This kind of robustness testing in our approach was strongly depended on the
algorithm we are using. We can conclude that by using these two objectives, we
can reduce the cost of testing and time consuming.
